Web Scraping and Summarization Pipeline
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Python-based solution that performs the following tasks:

Web scraping of cybersecurity vulnerability data.
Summarization of extracted data using pre-trained transformer models.
Visualization of the extracted and processed data.
Features
Web Scraping: Extracts data from websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
Data Summarization: Summarizes vulnerability descriptions using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.
Data Visualization: Displays the summarized data using Plotly to show key metrics such as severity.
Fully Automated Setup: Automates dependency installation and web scraping with headless Chrome.

Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Install required dependencies:

!apt-get update
!apt-get install -y wget unzip chromium-browser libnss3 libgconf-2-4
!wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/114.0.5735.90/chromedriver_linux64.zip
!unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
!mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
!pip install selenium transformers plotly
Usage
Run the script for setting up the environment and fetching data:



python script_name.py
The script performs the following:

Scrapes cybersecurity vulnerabilities data.
Summarizes the description of the vulnerabilities using a transformer model.
Visualizes key data insights.
Module 1: Setup
Installs required dependencies for web scraping and transformer models, such as Selenium and Chromedriver.

Module 2: Web Scraping
Scrapes the data from CVE Details using a headless Chrome browser managed by Selenium. Data is parsed from HTML tables and saved into a pandas DataFrame.

Module 3: Summarization
Uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to summarize the descriptions of vulnerabilities. The descriptions are passed through the model, which generates concise summaries.

Module 4: Visualization
Visualizes important data metrics using Plotly. For example, a bar chart of the number of incidents based on their severity.

Dependencies
Selenium: Used for web scraping with headless Chrome.
BeautifulSoup: Parses the HTML content extracted via Selenium.
Transformers: Handles text summarization and natural language processing tasks.
Plotly: Visualizes the extracted and processed data.
You can install the dependencies with the following command:

!apt-get install -y libnss3 libgconf-2-4
!pip install selenium transformers plotly
